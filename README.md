# BetteRCon
BetteRCon is a cross-platform Battlefield Bad Company 2 / Battlefield 3 / Battlefield 4 / Battlefield Hardline RCON client/relay server. It is inspired by PRoCon, but uses modern C++ and synchronization techniques to produce unparalleled performance. It is currently under development and has no official release yet, and the master branch is not yet stable, but will be once more features are added.
